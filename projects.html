                <h2>1.Project on Face Detection and Face Recognition using Computer Vision</h2>
                <p>Intel's OpenCV is a free and open-access image and video processing library. It is linked to computer vision, like feature and object recognition and machine learning. This paper presents the main OpenCV modules, features, and  OpenCV based  on Python.  The paper also presents  common OpenCV  applications and  classifiers used in these applications like image processing, face detection, face recognition, and object detection. Finally, we discuss some literary reviews of OpenCV applications in the fields of computer vision such as face detection and recognition, or recognition of facial expressions such as sadness, anger, happiness, or recognition of the gender and age of a person

                <h2>2.Project on Handwritten Digits using Autoencoders  </h2>
                <p>Recognition of isolated handwritten digits is a well-studied research problem and several models show high recognition accuracy on different standard datasets. But the same is not true while we consider recognition of handwritten digit strings although it has many real-life applications like bank cheque processing, postal code recognition, and numeric field understanding from filled-in form images. The problem becomes more difficult when digits in the string are not neatly written which is commonly seen in freestyle handwriting. The performance of any such model primarily suffers due to the presence of touching digits in the string. To handle these issues, in the present work, we first use a deep autoencoder based segmentation technique for isolating the digits from a handwritten digit string, and then we pass the isolated digits to a Residual Network (ResNet) based recognition model to obtain the machine-encoded digit string. The proposed model has been evaluated on the Computer Vision Lab (CVL) Handwritten Digit Strings (HDS) database, used in HDSRC 2013 competition on handwritten digit string recognition, and a competent result with respect to state-of-the-art techniques has been achieved.

                <h2>3.SMS Spam Filtering</h2>
                <p>Mobile or SMS spam is a real and growing problem primarily due to the availability of very cheap bulk pre-pay SMS packages and the fact that SMS engenders higher response rates as it is a trusted and personal service. SMS spam filtering is a relatively new task which inherits many issues and solutions from email spam filtering. However it poses its own specific challenges. This paper motivates work on filtering SMS spam and reviews recent developments in SMS spam filtering. The paper also discusses the issues with data collection and availability for furthering research in this area, analyses a large corpus of SMS spam, and provides some initial benchmark results.</p>
